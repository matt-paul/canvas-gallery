I have started off by creating an API using Express as it offers a simple way to get a suitable server going.

I then created some mock picture data, to serve on the pictures endpoint.  The server is running on port 8000.

Next, I used the create-react-app for a boilerplate react app 'frontend' on port 3000, and have fetched the mock picture list from the server.

Next..post picture to the server.....
